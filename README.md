About
--------------
This is a simple game to test how well you can guess a color shade based on its RGB values.<br>
When you start the game, a RGB color in the format RGB(x, y, z) will be presented to you and some squares with different
colors will appear. Click the one you find it is the correspodent color.<br>
On the "easy mode", you will have to guess out of three shades. On the "hard mode", you will have to choose one out of six.
